.TH PRETTY-APT-LOG 1 2024 PRETTY-APT-LOG\ 0.1.1

.SH NAME
pretty-apt-log \- view APT logs in an easy-to-read format

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY
\fBpretty-apt-log\fR [<options>] [<log> ...]
.YS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpretty-apt-log\fR allows the user to quickly view APT package manager's logs in an easy-to-read format. Each entry includes a date/time range showing the start and end time of the installation, and the command that was run.

\fBpretty-apt-log\fR requires `bat` to be installed to colorize the output. If `bat` is not installed, the output will not be colorized.

If no <log> file is passed as an argument, all the available logs in `/var/log/apt` are concatenated together, and displayed in the output. This includes the `history.log` file, and the numbered `history.log.<number>.gz` archive files.

Otherwise, both `.gz` files and plain text log files can be passed as arguments to \fBpretty-apt-log\fR. In that case, only the information from those files, concatenated together, is displayed.

.TP
.B -f, --date-format\fR=<value>
Date format string that changes how date/time is displayed in the output. This is the same as the \fIFORMAT\fR string of the `date` command. See \fBdate\fR(1) for more details.

The default value is `%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S`.

.TP
